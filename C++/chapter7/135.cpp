In C++, function arguments can be passed in two ways: by value and by reference.
Pass by Value:
When an argument is passed by value, a copy of the argument's value is created and passed to the function. The function then works with this copy, and any changes made to the copy inside the function do not affect the original variable outside the function. 
Pass by Reference:
When an argument is passed by reference, a reference (or memory address) to the original variable is passed to the function. This allows the function to directly access and modify the original variable. Any changes made to the variable inside the function are reflected outside the function.
Contiguous memory allocation allocates consecutive blocks of memory to a file/process. Non-Contiguous memory allocation allocates separate blocks of memory to a file/process.
