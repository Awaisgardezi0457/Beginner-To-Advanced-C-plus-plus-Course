//scope of variable:
//as we've declared a variable inside for loop so we can use that variable inside that
//and outside it'll give error.this is scope of variable.
//Simply,where a variable is declared it can only be used there and else nowhere.
//if we've declared a function in a variable it can only be used there and cannot be used in another function.
