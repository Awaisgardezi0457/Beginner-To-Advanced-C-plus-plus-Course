//Functions and Pointers:
//kinda similar like loops and are used to reduce repeatedness.
// in programming,there is a term dry,which means do not repeat yourself.
//loops are used when we used to print something multiple times.
//functions are used to map one value with another so it becomes easy for us to just assign a value and a task will be performed.
//Basically,functions are used to:
/*
1)tackle repitition. 
2)there are certain piece of code that we use alot of times in our life. like we swap two numbers that's why we use functions.
