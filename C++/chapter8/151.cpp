//2D arrays
//vectors we study them to they are in which we can extend arra elements dynamically.
//2D arrays:
/*what and Why?:
So,far we have explored arrays with only one dimension.It is also possile for Arrays to have
2 or more dimensions.The two dimensional array is also called a Matrix. 
int arr[r][c]
This a 2d array where r depicts number of rows in a matrix and c depicts the number of columns. 
in the matrix. 
/*
//if you consider an array as a list then a 2D array is a Table.
// Decleration:
// int arr[4][3];
