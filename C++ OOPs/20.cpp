//Access Modifiers:
//It is a moderately important topic.
//Access Modifiers are those as you know when we make a class in a program we write 
//public in it and without it we cannot access the code.
//Now,we'll discuss that when we don't write public: then why error occured.
//This was all because public is a access modifier.
/*
We have three types of access modifiers:
->public ->protected ->private 
we'll use private here first and then in inheritance we'll study about protected. 
we'll also study getters and setters.
