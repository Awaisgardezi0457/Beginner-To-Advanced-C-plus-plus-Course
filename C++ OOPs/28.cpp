//Polymorphism:
//Several forms of a Single Thing.
//Example a person we take,he/she can be a father/Mother,brother,husband/wife,brother/sister,son/daughter etc.
//So,one person but exists in many forms.
/*
Polymorphism is of two Types:
1)Run-Time.
2)Compile Time. 
The compile Time is more important. 
With function Overloading we can understand it.
Basically,Function Overloading is a Compile Time Polymorphism. 
You can understand compile time and run time poly morphism by understanding errors in
Compile time And Run-time. 
Compile time errors are syntactical errors like we've missed a semi-colon. We've Capital
a Word in An Array Or easy I can say,I have capitalized int. 
Runtime error is the error which could not be traced in compile time and could be 
traced in runtime while the program is running. 
Like I write int x=3/0; it would not be traced in Compile time it will be trace in run-time
and give output as invalid operation. 
it also includes errors of index out of bounds.
